## 🏷️ Overview

The **slot–listener–signal** system is a **coroutine-based abstraction for
eager, time-sensitive signal handling**.

It is designed for **engineering scenarios where responsiveness matters more
than completeness**:

* events must be handled *now* or *never*,
* stale or redundant events must be **discarded**,
* implicit buffering is harmful,
* implicit synchronization is forbidden.

This system is **not** a queue, **not** a pub/sub framework, and **not**
a scheduling runtime.

It is a structured way to write **asynchronous state machines** that react
to external signals under **explicit backpressure and timeout expectations**.

---

## 🧭 Design Philosophy

### Asynchronous Means Asynchronous

This system follows one core rule:

> **Do not mix asynchronous logic with implicit synchronization.**

If multiple operations are logically related, they **must be synchronized
explicitly** by the user *before* entering the slot system.

The slot system will never:

* align events from different sources,
* infer barriers or rounds,
* buffer values to “wait for the rest”.

If synchronization is required, it must be **external and explicit**.
Once synchronized, the result should be delivered as **one logical event**.

---

## 🚫 Why There Are No Queues

Traditional event systems rely on **physical queues**.
This design deliberately rejects them.

### Why queues are harmful here

In reactive systems, queues cause pathological behavior:

* outdated events are stored,
* repeated erroneous triggers accumulate,
* newer and more relevant events are delayed,
* the system reacts to history instead of reality.

This is especially dangerous when:

* signals represent *intent* rather than data,
* operations may invalidate each other,
* frequency spikes indicate overload or failure.

In such systems, **late execution is worse than no execution**.

---

## ⏱️ Backpressure by Rejection, Not Buffering

Instead of queues, this system uses **timed admission**:

* emitters attempt to deliver an event,
* if delivery cannot happen within a timeout,
* the event is **rejected immediately**.

Semantics:

* emitters effectively queue **themselves**, not their data,
* if delivery succeeds:

  ```
  deliver → resume → consume → clear
  ```
* if delivery fails:

    * nothing is stored,
    * the emitter is informed.

This enforces a strict rule:

> **If events arrive too frequently, they must be dropped.**

Frequent timeouts are a **signal**, not a failure:
they indicate overload, instability, or misdesigned upstream logic.

---

## 🧱 Core Components

### 🔹 `slot`

A `slot` is a **coroutine-based state machine**.

Properties:

* it is the **only execution context** in the system,
* it runs on the thread where `spawn()` is called,
* it has no thread of its own,
* it advances only when explicitly resumed by events.

A slot defines:

* phases,
* state transitions,
* routing,
* filtering,
* fan-out logic.

---

### 🔹 `slot_hub`

A `slot_hub` defines a **synchronization and lifetime domain**.

Rules:

* exactly **one slot per hub**,
* any number of listeners may be created,
* all listeners forward events to the same slot.

The hub enforces:

* timeout policy,
* admission control,
* unified lifetime.

---

### 🔹 `listener<T>`

A `listener<T>` defines **what constitutes one logical input step**.

Important properties:

* a listener holds **at most one in-flight value**,
* it is not a queue,
* it aggregates fan-in from multiple signals,
* it resumes the slot synchronously.

Listeners are **awaited**, not polled.

---

### 🔹 `event_signal<T>`

An `event_signal` is a **push-only injector**.

It:

* does not buffer,
* does not fan out,
* does not route,
* simply attempts to deliver a value to its listener.

All higher-level logic belongs to the slot.

---

## 🧠 Listener Payload Semantics

Different listener payload types express **different intent**.

### `listener<std::tuple<A, B>>`

> **Multiple values are required simultaneously for one logical step.**

* `A` and `B` are produced together.
* Any synchronization is handled externally.
* The slot observes one atomic input.

Use this when inputs are **inherently synchronous**.

---

### `listener<std::tuple<ID, Value>>`

> **Multiple sources, same value type (fan-in).**

* many producers,
* same payload type,
* source identity encoded via `ID`.

Each emission is an independent step.

---

### `listener<std::tuple<ID, std::variant<...>>>`

> **Multiple sources, heterogeneous payloads.**

* different producers,
* different data types,
* unified delivery channel.

Type-safe multiplexing without parallel awaits.

---

## ⚠️ Await Discipline (Hard Rule)

A slot may await **exactly one listener at a time**.

This is **forbidden**:

```cpp
auto a = co_await A;
auto b = co_await B; // ❌
```

Why:

* this assumes loose synchronization between sources,
* it requires one source not to advance faster than the other,
* such guarantees do not exist in asynchronous systems.

If one source advances faster:

* the state machine desynchronizes,
* behavior becomes undefined.

This is **not an implementation limitation**.
It is a semantic rule.

---

## 🔄 Phase-Based Listening

Although a hub may create multiple listeners, they are used **across phases**, not in parallel.

Correct pattern:

```cpp
// Phase 1
for (;;) {
auto v = co_await listener_A;
if (v == STOP) break;
co_yield {};
}

// Phase 2
for (;;) {
auto s = co_await listener_B;
co_yield {};
}
```

Listener switching represents **explicit state transitions**.

---

## 🧩 Example — Eager Signal Handling with `slot`

This example demonstrates a **time-sensitive signal–slot setup** where:

* events are handled immediately or dropped,
* no buffering is involved,
* the `slot` acts as a state machine reacting to signals.

---

### 🔹 Step 1 — Create the Hub

The hub defines the **synchronization domain** and the **timeout policy**.

```cpp
using namespace std::chrono_literals;

jh::async::slot_hub hub(50ms);   // reject events that cannot be delivered within 50ms
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2 — Create a Listener

Listeners are created from the hub and define **one logical input step**.

```cpp
auto li = hub.make_listener<int>();
```

---

### 🔹 Step 3 — Define the Slot Coroutine

The slot is a coroutine that:

* waits for events via `co_await listener`,
* processes exactly one event per iteration,
* yields control explicitly.

```cpp
auto make_slot = [&](jh::async::listener<int>& li) -> jh::async::slot {
    std::puts("[slot] started");

    for (;;) {
        int v = co_await li;          // wait for next event
        std::printf("[slot] value = %d\n", v);

        // state machine logic goes here

        co_yield {};                  // explicit step boundary
    }
};
```

---

### 🔹 Step 4 — Bind Signal to Listener

Signals are **push-only** and must be connected before emitting.

```cpp
jh::async::event_signal<int> sig;
sig.connect(&li);
```

---

### 🔹 Step 5 — Create and Bind the Slot

Each hub may bind **exactly one slot**.

```cpp
jh::async::slot s = make_slot(li);
hub.bind_slot(s);
```

---

### 🔹 Step 6 — Spawn the Slot

Spawning:

* starts the coroutine,
* binds it permanently to the calling thread.

```cpp
s.spawn();
```

From this point on, any successful `emit()` will resume the slot coroutine.

---

### 🔹 Step 7 — Emit Events

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    bool accepted = sig.emit(i);

    if (!accepted) {
        std::puts("[emit] dropped (timeout)");
    }

    std::this_thread::sleep_for(10ms);
}
```

Semantics:

* if the slot is ready and the hub lock is acquired → event is delivered,
* if not → event is dropped immediately.

---

## 🎯 Intended Use Cases

This system is designed for:

* reactive control logic,
* protocol state machines,
* signal-driven workflows,
* UI / input handling,
* systems where **freshness beats completeness**.

It is **not** designed for:

* logging,
* job queues,
* batch processing,
* guaranteed delivery pipelines.

---

## 🧠 Summary

* Slots are **state machines**, not workers.
* Listeners define **one logical input step**.
* Fan-in is explicit; fan-out is user-defined.
* Synchronization is **never implicit**.
* Backpressure is enforced by **dropping events**, not buffering them.
* If something arrives too often, it is **wrong**, and must be discarded.
