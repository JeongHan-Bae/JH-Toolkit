        We primarily support embedded documentation views in IDEs (classic CLion).
        To ensure compatibility with embedded rendering, some example code in this
        documentation intentionally contains HTML entities.
        In certain cases, Doxygen does not unescape these entities correctly.
        This is a known limitation and currently has no workaround.
