/**
 * @brief Aggregated entry point for coroutine-based asynchronous facilities.
 *
 * The <code>&lt;jh/async&gt;</code> forwarding header provides a unified,
 * engineering-oriented interface over the coroutine-based asynchronous
 * components implemented under <code>jh/asynchronous/</code>.
 * <br>
 * Rather than exposing raw coroutine primitives, this module presents
 * constrained and semantically well-defined abstractions such as
 * generators, fibers, and coroutine-backed signal slots.
 * <br>
 * This header is the recommended user-facing entry point as of v1.4.0.
 * Individual component headers remain fully supported.
