/**
 * @brief Aggregated namespace for concurrency-aware resource containers.
 *
 * The <code>&lt;jh/concurrency&gt;</code> forwarding header provides a unified,
 * engineering-oriented interface over the concurrency primitives implemented
 * under <code>jh/concurrent/</code>.
 * <br>
 * Rather than exposing raw locking primitives or requiring users to reason
 * about mutex choreography, <code>jh::conc</code> offers resource-centric
 * containers that encapsulate synchronization internally. APIs are shaped
 * around managed objects, keys, and handles, not explicit lock ownership.
 * <br>
 * This namespace aggregates facilities such as optimistic-concurrency boxes
 * and pool-based containers with well-defined ownership, observation, and
 * lifetime semantics.
 * <br>
 * The aggregated header <code>&lt;jh/concurrency&gt;</code> is the recommended
 * entry point for accessing these components. Individual headers under
 * <code>jh/concurrent/</code> remain fully supported.
