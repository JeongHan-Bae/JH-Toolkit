## üöÄ What's New in 1.3.x

JH Toolkit `1.3.x` brings enhancements focused on **STL interop**, **runtime-optimized structures**, and **modern `C++20` concept design** ‚Äî all while retaining **zero-overhead abstractions**.

- ‚ú® **`runtime_arr<T>`**  
  A fixed-size, heap-allocated array where **size is known at runtime**.  
  Designed to offer **raw-layout performance** and STL-like usability without dynamic resizing.  
  When initialized with primitive or POD types, `runtime_arr` avoids unnecessary heap operations and performs faster than `std::vector` in many **fully-initialized** scenarios (e.g., when compared to `std::vector(N)`).

- üîÅ **`sequence`** + **`views`**  
  `sequence` now supports `.to_range()` to expose **`std::ranges::input_range`-compatible views**, enabling smooth STL interop.  
  A new module `jh::views` introduces allocation-free range adaptors like `enumerate`, `zip`, and more ‚Äî **based on `sequence` rather than `range`**, ensuring type safety without RTTI.

- üåÄ **`generator<T>`**  
  Added support for **generator factories from callable objects**, including lambdas that return a `co_yield` generator.  
  This allows simple coroutine-based logic to integrate with pipelines via `to_range()` ‚Äî provided the generator is of the **non-`send`** (pure `co_yield`) kind.

- üîí **`immutable_str`**  
  Improved hash interop, transparent pointer compatibility, and ABI-safe layout.  
  Now supports **transparent key lookup** for hash tables:

  ```c++
  std::unordered_set<jh::atomic_str_ptr, jh::atomic_str_hash, jh::atomic_str_eq> pool;
  pool.insert(jh::make_atomic("cached"));

  if (pool.find("cached") != pool.end()) {
      // ‚úÖ No need to construct immutable_str for lookup
  }
  ```

> These updates make `1.3.x` the most robust and STL-aligned version yet ‚Äî ideal for performance-focused, modern C++ development across Linux, macOS, and Windows.


---

## üìå Requirements

- **C++20** (mandatory)
- **CMake 3.14+** (for library usage)
- **CMake 3.20+** (for full compilation and installation)
- **Git** (required for Debug mode builds)
- **A modern C++20 compiler**

> ‚úÖ CI-tested and recommended toolchains:

| Platform    | Recommended Compiler                                                    | Notes                                                                                  |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Linux**   | **GCC 12+**                                                             | CI uses `ubuntu-latest` with GCC 12                                                    |
| **macOS**   | **Apple Clang 16+** (Xcode 15.3+)<br>or **LLVM Clang 16+** via Homebrew | Use Homebrew LLVM if your Xcode version is older                                       |
| **Windows** | **MSYS2 UCRT64 (GCC 13+)**                                              | Older `mingw64` may lack support for `std::ranges`; use `ucrt64` to ensure correctness |

---

### üß† Compiler Compatibility Notes

- `jh-toolkit` depends on full support for:
  - `std::ranges::subrange`, `views`
  - `concepts`, `requires` constraints
  - coroutine features (`co_yield`, `co_return`)
  - aggregate initialization across POD inheritance
- ‚úÖ Minimum supported versions:
  - GCC 11+
  - Clang 15+
- ‚úÖ CI-tested:
  - GCC 12+
  - LLVM Clang 15+ (macOS)
  - MSYS2 UCRT64 GCC 13+ (Windows)

---

### ‚ùå Not Supported

- **MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++)**  
  Compilation with MSVC is **explicitly prohibited**.  
  Any MSVC toolchain will trigger a hard error via [`include/jh/utils/platform.h`](include/jh/utils/platform.h):

  > üõë Why?
  > - Incomplete support for C++20 `concepts`, `ranges`, and coroutine semantics
  > - Unstable `SFINAE` and template constraints
  > - ABI and STL inconsistencies across versions

  ‚úÖ Alternatives:
  - **MSYS2 (UCRT64) with GCC**
  - **WSL2 + Ubuntu GCC**
  - **MINGW-Clang for Windows**

---

### üö´ 32-bit Platforms

- JH Toolkit **does not support** 32-bit platforms (e.g., x86, ARMv7).
- A hard `static_assert(sizeof(std::size_t) == 8)` check will **prevent compilation** on such targets.
- This guarantees ABI consistency and avoids silent miscompilation from fake `-m64` flags or macro spoofing.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Windows ARM64 Note

- Native Windows ARM64 toolchains (e.g., MSYS2 `mingw64` or `clang64` for ARM64) are **not fully supported**.
- They often lack required `std::ranges` and concept resolution features.
- ‚úÖ Recommended:
  - Use **WSL2 + Ubuntu + GCC** for reliable ARM64 builds on Windows
  - Or cross-compile from a known-good x86_64 Linux system

---

### üì¶ MinGW Compatibility

> - Older `mingw64` toolchains (e.g., GitHub runners, system MinGW) **lack full support** for `std::ranges`, `concepts`, and coroutine semantics.
> - ‚úÖ However, **`jh::pod` modules** are fully supported even on older MinGW variants.
> - ‚úÖ If you're only using `jh-toolkit` as a **header-only POD utility**, then any modern C++20-capable MinGW will work.

‚úÖ Toolchains bundled with modern environments like **CLion**, **MSYS2**, or **VSCode + MSYS2** typically ship with **GCC 12+ or 13+**, and are fully compatible.

> üõ† For full module support (`generator`, `immutable_str`, `views`, `pool`, etc.), we recommend:

```bash
pacman -Syu
pacman -S --needed mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain
```

---

### üõ† Enabling C++20

Ensure your project explicitly enables **C++20**, otherwise `jh-toolkit` will not compile:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

---

### üì± Mobile & Embedded Targets

> ‚ùå JH Toolkit is **not intended for embedded systems or constrained environments**.
> Internals are 64-bit optimized and assume modern system-level allocators and CPU alignment.

> ‚úÖ For Android/iOS, use `add_subdirectory(jh-toolkit)` for tight ABI control ‚Äî do not preinstall or `find_package()`.

> üì¶ You may embed source directly and limit to `jh::pod` for ultra-minimal use cases.

---

### üß∞ Older CMake (< 3.20)

If you can't use `CMake 3.20+`, you can still:

- Include source directly in your CMake tree
- Use `#include "jh/..."`
- Link individual `.cpp` manually (non-header-only modules)

---

‚úÖ Local embedding works reliably on:

- Linux/macOS desktops
- CI runners
- Mobile cross-compilation

üö´ Not recommended for:

- 32-bit builds
- Bare-metal / embedded
- MSVC-based platforms

---

## üì• Installation

#### üî∏ **Option 1: Latest Stable Version (1.3+ Ongoing)**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/JeongHan-Bae/jh-toolkit.git
```

#### üîπ **Option 2: Latest LTS Release (1.3.0+)**
```sh
git clone --branch 1.3.x-LTS --depth=1 https://github.com/JeongHan-Bae/jh-toolkit.git
```
üëâ Or download from: **[JH Toolkit Latest LTS Release](https://github.com/JeongHan-Bae/JH-Toolkit/releases/latest)**

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Build and Install

#### üîπ Full Version (Default)

```sh
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
sudo cmake --install build
```

This installs the complete **`jh-toolkit`**:

- Provides full header sets and implementation.
- Use `jh::jh-toolkit` and `jh::jh-toolkit-impl`.

Recommended on development machines or when full functionality is needed.

---

#### üî∏ Minimal Version (Header-only POD system)

```sh
cmake -B build-pod -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTAR=POD
cmake --build build-pod
sudo cmake --install build-pod
```

This installs only the **POD system**:

- A lightweight, header-only C++20 template library.
- Use `jh::jh-toolkit-pod`.

Recommended for minimal deployment, embedding, or when implementation is not needed.

üìñ See [docs/pod.md](docs/pod.md) for usage details.

---

#### üß© Custom Build Modes for Modular Deployments

You can selectively build and install specific components using:

```sh
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTAR=POD,ALL
```

- The `TAR` option accepts a comma-separated list of target modules to include.
- Currently supported values: `POD`, `ALL`
- Targets are **individually downloadable and usable** depending on your deployment needs.

Use case examples:

| Usage Context       | Suggested `TAR` Value | What It Builds                       |
|---------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Minimal runtime     | `POD`                 | Header-only POD system               |
| Development machine | `ALL`                 | Everything: headers + implementation |
| Shared dependency   | `POD,ALL`             | All targets available in local build |

> ‚úÖ `TAR=POD,ALL` makes all targets available without restricting modularity.  
> This allows dependent projects to only link what they need.

---

#### üì¶ Installed Targets by Build Mode

| Build Mode           | CMake Targets Available                 | Description                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `TAR=ALL` (default)  | `jh::jh-toolkit`, `jh::jh-toolkit-impl` | Full header set + implementation          |
| `TAR=POD`            | `jh::jh-toolkit-pod`                    | Header-only POD module                    |
| `TAR=POD,ALL`        | All above targets                       | Maximum availability, optional usage      |

All modes are compatible with:

```cmake
find_package(jh-toolkit REQUIRED)
```

Then link only the targets your project needs.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Installation

If installation is successful, you should be able to include and use `jh-toolkit` in a minimal program:

```c++
#include <jh/immutable_str> // or <jh/immutable_str.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    auto pool = jh::pool<jh::immutable_str>();
    const auto str = pool.acquire("Hello, JH Toolkit!");
    std::cout << str->view() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

If this compiles and runs successfully, `jh-toolkit` is correctly installed.

## üì¶ Usage

### CMake Integration

Add `jh-toolkit` to your project:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(my_project LANGUAGES CXX)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

find_package(jh-toolkit REQUIRED)

add_executable(my_project main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_project PRIVATE jh::jh-toolkit) # For header-only modules
target_link_libraries(my_project PRIVATE jh::jh-toolkit-impl) # For compiled components
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Debug Build Setup

Build and test the project using standard `Debug` or performance-friendly `FastDebug` modes:

```sh
cmake -B build-debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```
**or**
```sh
cmake -B build-debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=FastDebug
```
**then**
```sh
cmake --build build-debug
ctest --test-dir build-debug --output-on-failure
```

---

#### üß™ Fast, CI-friendly Testing

- All unit tests are registered with `ctest`.
- Most modules are mature and run limited randomized iterations (e.g., 128 rounds).
- Suitable for rapid regression checks and automation pipelines.

---

#### üõ†Ô∏è FastDebug vs Debug

| Mode          | Optimization | Debug Info | Use Case                                             |
|---------------|--------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Debug**     | `-O0`        | ‚úÖ `-g`     | Traditional debug builds; full symbolic debugging    |
| **FastDebug** | `-O2`        | ‚úÖ `-g`     | Faster test execution with minimal optimization bias |

---

#### üö´ What FastDebug *Does Not* Do

FastDebug **only** applies `-O2 -g` and intentionally avoids more aggressive compiler behaviors:

- ‚ùå No `-march=native`
- ‚ùå No auto-vectorization (`-ftree-vectorize`)
- ‚ùå No loop unrolling (`-funroll-loops`)
- ‚ùå No SIMD-only code paths

This ensures consistent runtime behavior and portability across CI runners or developer machines.

> ‚úÖ **FastDebug mode not only speeds up testing, but also helps identify bugs that only appear under compiler optimizations (e.g., undefined behavior, aliasing issues, optimization-elided side effects).**

---

### üìå Notes

- üß™ All modules are covered by unit tests for **behavioral correctness**.
  - Modules like `generator` and `pool` are stable but **not yet micro-optimized**.
  - Core utility types such as `immutable_str` and `runtime_arr` are **micro-optimized** and designed for practical performance without sacrificing safety or clarity.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è On Lightweight Benchmarking

Some core modules include **lightweight, embedded benchmarks** in their test suites to validate real-world performance without requiring a full benchmarking framework.

- üß™ Modules with benchmarks:
  - `immutable_str`: A fully immutable, thread-safe string type optimized for hashing and interning.
  - `runtime_arr`: A fixed-size, non-resizable heap array with raw-layout speed and STL compatibility.
- üß™ Modules **without active benchmarks**:
  - `generator`, `pool`: Stable but not micro-optimized yet.

#### üìà Results Overview

- Benchmarks demonstrate that optimized modules are typically **comparable to STL** in performance.
- In specific cases, custom structures even **outperform STL** by reducing allocation or indirection overhead.
- Overhead remains **predictable and minimal** across compilers and optimization levels.

#### üß™ Running Benchmarks

- üöÄ Run test binaries directly to view timing output (no need for `ctest`).
- üìö Module documentation includes brief benchmark context and insights.

> ‚ùó No separate `benchmark/` directory or `tests/benchmark.cpp` exists; new performance testing will be added only when necessary.

---


### üõ† Build Behavior

- üîß Benchmarks, examples, and debugging tools are **disabled in Release builds**.
- üö´ Install is **disabled in Debug builds** to prevent accidental system changes.
- üîÅ Randomized test rounds are capped (e.g. 128 iterations) for long-verified modules ‚Äî ensuring reasonable CI duration without sacrificing coverage.

---

## üìö JH Toolkit Modules Overview

### üì¶ Template-Based Modules

Modern C++20 header-only components focused on **zero-cost abstraction**, **type safety**, and **performance-conscious design**.

## **üêç Pythonic Aesthetics and Philosophy in JH Toolkit**

While **JH Toolkit** is a modern C++20 library, its **design philosophy** embraces several key **Pythonic principles**, making C++ development **more expressive, efficient, and intuitive**. These principles shape how `jh-toolkit` is structured, promoting **readability, maintainability, and performance**.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Duck Typing: Behavior Over Declaration**
> _"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck."_

- **How JH Toolkit Implements This**:
    - **`jh::pool<T>` automatically detects compatible types** (requires `T::hash()` and `operator==`).
    - **`jh::sequence` validates immutable iteration at compile time**, without requiring explicit inheritance.
    - **`jh::iterator<>` concepts ensure iterators conform to expected behavior**, rather than relying on inheritance.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Lazy Evaluation: Compute Only When Necessary**
> _"Better to compute only when needed than to compute everything upfront."_

- **How JH Toolkit Implements This**:
    - **`jh::generator<T, U>` defers computation** using coroutines.
    - **`jh::immutable_str` delays hash computation** until the first `hash()` call, avoiding unnecessary processing.
    - **`jh::pool<T>` manages objects dynamically**, avoiding upfront allocation.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Automatic Memory Management: Smart and Efficient Resource Handling**
> _"Memory management should be handled by the system, not by the user."_

- **How JH Toolkit Implements This**:
    - **`jh::sim_pool<T, Hash, Eq>` uses `std::weak_ptr<T>`** to automatically expire objects.
    - **`jh::pool<T>` ensures memory deduplication** without requiring manual object tracking.
    - **Automatic cleanup** is built into pooling mechanisms, similar to **Python‚Äôs garbage collection**.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Explicit is Better Than Implicit: Preventing Unintended Behavior**
> _"Code should be clear in its intentions and prevent implicit conversions that cause ambiguity."_

- **How JH Toolkit Implements This**:
    - **`jh::immutable_str` prohibits implicit conversions** that could lead to data races.
    - **`jh::generator<T, U>` is explicitly move-only**, preventing unintended copies.
    - **Concept-based design** enforces correctness at compile time.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Readability and Maintainability: Expressive and Clean Code**
> _"Code is read more often than it is written."_

- **How JH Toolkit Implements This**:
    - **Encapsulates complexity into reusable, well-documented modules**.
    - **Uses concepts to provide clear type constraints** rather than relying on SFINAE.
    - **Promotes modularity and interoperability** with standard C++20 features.

### **üîπ Why This Matters**
By following these Pythonic principles, **JH Toolkit makes modern C++ more ergonomic**, helping developers write **concise, expressive, and high-performance** code while reducing **boilerplate and maintenance costs**.

---

## **üîπ Why `snake_case`? Aligning with `std` for a Seamless Toolkit Experience**

JH Toolkit follows **`snake_case` naming conventions**, aligning with **C++ standard library (`std`)** rather than the more common **`camelCase` or `CapitalCase`** styles used by other third-party libraries. This choice is intentional and deeply rooted in **our goal of providing a seamless, toolkit-like experience** for developers.

### **üìå 1. Consistency with the Standard Library**
> _"A toolkit should feel like a natural extension of the language."_

- The C++ **Standard Library (`std`) uses `snake_case`** for its core utilities, including:
    - **Type traits** (`std::is_same_v`, `std::decay_t`)
    - **Containers** (`std::vector`, `std::unordered_map`)
    - **Iterators & Algorithms** (`std::next`, `std::find_if`)
    - **Concepts in C++20** (`std::same_as`, `std::convertible_to`)

- By **mirroring `std` naming conventions**, **JH Toolkit blends naturally** into the developer's codebase, reducing **cognitive overhead**.


### **üìå 2. JH Toolkit is Primarily a Data Structure & Template Library**
> _"JH Toolkit is not just a utility collection; it's a core toolkit."_

- Many third-party C++ libraries, especially frameworks, use **`CamelCase`** (`Boost`, `Qt`) or **`CapitalCase`** (`Eigen`, `OpenCV`).
- However, **JH Toolkit is a toolkit for generic data structures and utilities**, not a high-level framework.
- **Using `snake_case` ensures users interact with JH Toolkit just like they do with `std`**, making it feel **native to modern C++ development**.


### **üìå 3. Improved Readability & Seamless Integration**
> _"The best tools are the ones that feel like they were always there."_

- `snake_case` improves **readability** when dealing with **template-heavy, generic code**.
- Developers using **JH Toolkit alongside `std` will experience a uniform interface**, making it easier to:
    - **Mix and match `std` and `jh` components.**
    - **Reduce friction when integrating `jh-toolkit` into existing projects.**
    - **Lower the learning curve for new users already familiar with `std`.**

### **üìå 4. Future-Proofing for C++ Evolution**
> _"Following the direction of the standard makes long-term maintenance easier."_

- C++ is increasingly adopting **concept-based design** and modern **generic programming paradigms**.
- JH Toolkit **embraces these trends** by ensuring **consistent naming conventions** for **concepts, iterators, and utilities**.
- By aligning with `std`, JH Toolkit remains **future-proof** and **less likely to require adaptation** when integrating with **new standard features**.
