üöÄ **JH Toolkit 1.3.0-dev - Expanding Core Features!**

## üìå Requirements

- **C++20** (mandatory)
- **CMake 3.14+** (for library usage)
- **CMake 3.20+** (for library compilation and installation)
- **Git** (required for debugging mode compilation)
- **A modern C++20 compiler** (GCC 10+, Clang 10+)
  > **GCC(MinGW)**, **Clang** are tested and supported in every release.
  > **MSVC is not supported** due to its limited support for C++20 features. We do not plan to downgrade to match MSVC's capabilities, so users should use GCC or Clang instead.
  > For **Windows ARM64**, native support for MinGW is limited. We recommend using **GCC within WSL2** to achieve near-native performance.
  
Ensure your project enables **C++20**, otherwise `jh-toolkit` will not compile:
```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Not Designed for Embedded or 32-bit Platforms**  
> JH Toolkit is designed for **modern 64-bit systems** (x86_64, ARM64). All container internals use  
> `uint64_t` for `size_`, and STL compatibility **requires `size()` to match `uint64_t` semantics**.  
> As a result, **embedded targets or 32-bit builds are not supported**.

> üì± **Mobile (Android/iOS) and Cross-Compiling Notes**  
> When targeting **mobile platforms**, we strongly recommend **project-local integration** (e.g., `add_subdirectory(jh-toolkit)`)  
> instead of precompiled `install` + `find_package()`.
>
> This avoids **ABI mismatch issues** when pulling desktop-compiled binaries into mobile toolchains  
> (e.g., NDK, Xcode, etc.), and allows tight control over architecture-specific builds.

> üß∞ **CMake < 3.20 Systems**  
> If your system does not support `CMake 3.20+`, you can still:
> - Include the source directly in your CMake tree.
> - Use `#include "jh/header"` instead of `#include <jh/header>`.
> - Manually link `.cpp` sources for non-header-only modules.

> ‚úÖ Local embedding works well on modern Linux/macOS desktops, CI runners, or mobile SDKs ‚Äî  
> just **not embedded** or **resource-constrained systems**.

## üì• Installation

#### üî∏ **Option 1: Latest Development Version (1.2+ - Ongoing Updates)**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/JeongHan-Bae/jh-toolkit.git
```

#### üîπ **Option 2: Latest LTS Release (1.2.3+)**
```sh
git clone --branch 1.2.x-LTS --depth=1 https://github.com/JeongHan-Bae/jh-toolkit.git
```
üëâ Or download from: **[JH Toolkit Latest LTS Release](https://github.com/JeongHan-Bae/JH-Toolkit/releases/latest)**

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Build and Install
---

#### üîπ Full Version (Default)

```sh
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
sudo cmake --install build
```

This installs the complete **`jh-toolkit`**:

- Provides full header sets and implementation.
- Use `jh::jh-toolkit` and `jh::jh-toolkit-impl`.

Recommended on development machines or when full functionality is needed.

---

#### üî∏ Minimal Version (Header-only POD system)

```sh
cmake -B build-pod -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTAR=POD
cmake --build build-pod
sudo cmake --install build-pod
```

This installs only the **POD system**:

- A lightweight, header-only C++20 template library.
- Use `jh::jh-toolkit-pod`.

Recommended for minimal deployment, embedding, or when implementation is not needed.

üìñ See [docs/pod.md](docs/pod.md) for usage details.

---

#### üß© Custom Build Modes for Modular Deployments

You can selectively build and install specific components using:

```sh
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTAR=POD,ALL
```

- The `TAR` option accepts a comma-separated list of target modules to include.
- Currently supported values: `POD`, `ALL`
- Targets are **individually downloadable and usable** depending on your deployment needs.

Use case examples:

| Usage Context       | Suggested `TAR` Value | What It Builds                       |
|---------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Minimal runtime     | `POD`                 | Header-only POD system               |
| Development machine | `ALL`                 | Everything: headers + implementation |
| Shared dependency   | `POD,ALL`             | All targets available in local build |

> ‚úÖ `TAR=POD,ALL` makes all targets available without restricting modularity.  
> This allows dependent projects to only link what they need.

---

#### üì¶ Installed Targets by Build Mode

| Build Mode           | CMake Targets Available                 | Description                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `TAR=ALL` (default)  | `jh::jh-toolkit`, `jh::jh-toolkit-impl` | Full header set + implementation          |
| `TAR=POD`            | `jh::jh-toolkit-pod`                    | Header-only POD module                    |
| `TAR=POD,ALL`        | All above targets                       | Maximum availability, optional usage      |

All modes are compatible with:

```cmake
find_package(jh-toolkit REQUIRED)
```

Then link only the targets your project needs.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Installation

If installation is successful, you should be able to include and use `jh-toolkit` in a minimal program:

```c++
#include <jh/immutable_str> // or <jh/immutable_str.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    auto pool = jh::pool<jh::immutable_str>();
    const auto str = pool.acquire("Hello, JH Toolkit!");
    std::cout << str->view() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

If this compiles and runs successfully, `jh-toolkit` is correctly installed.

## üì¶ Usage

### CMake Integration

Add `jh-toolkit` to your project:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(my_project LANGUAGES CXX)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

find_package(jh-toolkit REQUIRED)

add_executable(my_project main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_project PRIVATE jh::jh-toolkit) # For header-only modules
target_link_libraries(my_project PRIVATE jh::jh-toolkit-impl) # For compiled components
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Debug Build Setup

Build and test the project using standard `Debug` or performance-friendly `FastDebug` modes:

```sh
cmake -B build-debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```
**or**
```sh
cmake -B build-debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=FastDebug
```
**then**
```sh
cmake --build build-debug
ctest --test-dir build-debug --output-on-failure
```

---

#### üß™ Fast, CI-friendly Testing

- All unit tests are registered with `ctest`.
- Most modules are mature and run limited randomized iterations (e.g., 128 rounds).
- Suitable for rapid regression checks and automation pipelines.

---

#### üõ†Ô∏è FastDebug vs Debug

| Mode          | Optimization | Debug Info | Use Case                                             |
|---------------|--------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Debug**     | `-O0`        | ‚úÖ `-g`     | Traditional debug builds; full symbolic debugging    |
| **FastDebug** | `-O2`        | ‚úÖ `-g`     | Faster test execution with minimal optimization bias |

---

#### üö´ What FastDebug *Does Not* Do

FastDebug **only** applies `-O2 -g` and intentionally avoids more aggressive compiler behaviors:

- ‚ùå No `-march=native`
- ‚ùå No auto-vectorization (`-ftree-vectorize`)
- ‚ùå No loop unrolling (`-funroll-loops`)
- ‚ùå No SIMD-only code paths

This ensures consistent runtime behavior and portability across CI runners or developer machines.

> ‚úÖ **FastDebug mode not only speeds up testing, but also helps identify bugs that only appear under compiler optimizations (e.g., undefined behavior, aliasing issues, optimization-elided side effects).**

---

### üìå Notes

- üß™ All modules are covered by unit tests for **behavioral correctness**.
  - Modules like `generator` and `pool` are stable but **not yet micro-optimized**.
  - Core utility types such as `immutable_str` and `runtime_arr` are **micro-optimized** and designed for practical performance without sacrificing safety or clarity.
- üß© Modules like `data_sink` and `pod_stack` were previously benchmarked
  but are now deprecated due to consistently poor performance under optimization.  
  They have been **removed from test coverage and performance tracking**.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated Experimental Modules

- The previously benchmarked **`data_sink`** and **`pod_stack`** have been moved to the `/experimental` directory:
  - While they performed well under **Clang `-O0`/`-O1`**, they **underperformed STL by 10‚Äì20% at `-O2`**.
  - On **GCC**, performance dropped further due to missed optimization opportunities.
  - These modules are no longer maintained, and **no benchmark results will be provided going forward**.
- All `/experimental` modules:
  - Are **not part of the public API**.
  - May be removed or changed **without notice**.
  - Have **no performance or stability guarantees**.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è On Lightweight Benchmarking

Some core modules include **lightweight, embedded benchmarks** in their test suites to validate real-world performance without requiring a full benchmarking framework.

- üß™ Modules with benchmarks:
  - `immutable_str`: A fully immutable, thread-safe string type optimized for hashing and interning.
  - `runtime_arr`: A fixed-size, non-resizable heap array with raw-layout speed and STL compatibility.
- üß™ Modules **without active benchmarks**:
  - `generator`, `pool`: Stable but not micro-optimized yet.
  - `data_sink`, `pod_stack`: Deprecated and removed from performance consideration.

#### üìà Results Overview

- Benchmarks demonstrate that optimized modules are typically **comparable to STL** in performance.
- In specific cases, custom structures even **outperform STL** by reducing allocation or indirection overhead.
- Overhead remains **predictable and minimal** across compilers and optimization levels.

#### üß™ Running Benchmarks

- üöÄ Run test binaries directly to view timing output (no need for `ctest`).
- üìö Module documentation includes brief benchmark context and insights.

> ‚ùó No separate `benchmark/` directory or `tests/benchmark.cpp` exists; new performance testing will be added only when necessary.

---


### üõ† Build Behavior

- üîß Benchmarks, examples, and debugging tools are **disabled in Release builds**.
- üö´ Install is **disabled in Debug builds** to prevent accidental system changes.
- üîÅ Randomized test rounds are capped (e.g. 128 iterations) for long-verified modules ‚Äî ensuring reasonable CI duration without sacrificing coverage.

## **üêç Pythonic Aesthetics and Philosophy in JH Toolkit**

While **JH Toolkit** is a modern C++20 library, its **design philosophy** embraces several key **Pythonic principles**, making C++ development **more expressive, efficient, and intuitive**. These principles shape how `jh-toolkit` is structured, promoting **readability, maintainability, and performance**.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Duck Typing: Behavior Over Declaration**
> _"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck."_

- **How JH Toolkit Implements This**:
    - **`jh::pool<T>` automatically detects compatible types** (requires `T::hash()` and `operator==`).
    - **`jh::sequence` validates immutable iteration at compile time**, without requiring explicit inheritance.
    - **`jh::iterator<>` concepts ensure iterators conform to expected behavior**, rather than relying on inheritance.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Lazy Evaluation: Compute Only When Necessary**
> _"Better to compute only when needed than to compute everything upfront."_

- **How JH Toolkit Implements This**:
    - **`jh::generator<T, U>` defers computation** using coroutines.
    - **`jh::immutable_str` delays hash computation** until the first `hash()` call, avoiding unnecessary processing.
    - **`jh::pool<T>` manages objects dynamically**, avoiding upfront allocation.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Automatic Memory Management: Smart and Efficient Resource Handling**
> _"Memory management should be handled by the system, not by the user."_

- **How JH Toolkit Implements This**:
    - **`jh::sim_pool<T, Hash, Eq>` uses `std::weak_ptr<T>`** to automatically expire objects.
    - **`jh::pool<T>` ensures memory deduplication** without requiring manual object tracking.
    - **Automatic cleanup** is built into pooling mechanisms, similar to **Python‚Äôs garbage collection**.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Explicit is Better Than Implicit: Preventing Unintended Behavior**
> _"Code should be clear in its intentions and prevent implicit conversions that cause ambiguity."_

- **How JH Toolkit Implements This**:
    - **`jh::immutable_str` prohibits implicit conversions** that could lead to data races.
    - **`jh::generator<T, U>` is explicitly move-only**, preventing unintended copies.
    - **Concept-based design** enforces correctness at compile time.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Readability and Maintainability: Expressive and Clean Code**
> _"Code is read more often than it is written."_

- **How JH Toolkit Implements This**:
    - **Encapsulates complexity into reusable, well-documented modules**.
    - **Uses concepts to provide clear type constraints** rather than relying on SFINAE.
    - **Promotes modularity and interoperability** with standard C++20 features.

### **üîπ Why This Matters**
By following these Pythonic principles, **JH Toolkit makes modern C++ more ergonomic**, helping developers write **concise, expressive, and high-performance** code while reducing **boilerplate and maintenance costs**.

---

## **üîπ Why `snake_case`? Aligning with `std` for a Seamless Toolkit Experience**

JH Toolkit follows **`snake_case` naming conventions**, aligning with **C++ standard library (`std`)** rather than the more common **`camelCase` or `CapitalCase`** styles used by other third-party libraries. This choice is intentional and deeply rooted in **our goal of providing a seamless, toolkit-like experience** for developers.

### **üìå 1. Consistency with the Standard Library**
> _"A toolkit should feel like a natural extension of the language."_

- The C++ **Standard Library (`std`) uses `snake_case`** for its core utilities, including:
    - **Type traits** (`std::is_same_v`, `std::decay_t`)
    - **Containers** (`std::vector`, `std::unordered_map`)
    - **Iterators & Algorithms** (`std::next`, `std::find_if`)
    - **Concepts in C++20** (`std::same_as`, `std::convertible_to`)

- By **mirroring `std` naming conventions**, **JH Toolkit blends naturally** into the developer's codebase, reducing **cognitive overhead**.


### **üìå 2. JH Toolkit is Primarily a Data Structure & Template Library**
> _"JH Toolkit is not just a utility collection; it's a core toolkit."_

- Many third-party C++ libraries, especially frameworks, use **`CamelCase`** (`Boost`, `Qt`) or **`CapitalCase`** (`Eigen`, `OpenCV`).
- However, **JH Toolkit is a toolkit for generic data structures and utilities**, not a high-level framework.
- **Using `snake_case` ensures users interact with JH Toolkit just like they do with `std`**, making it feel **native to modern C++ development**.


### **üìå 3. Improved Readability & Seamless Integration**
> _"The best tools are the ones that feel like they were always there."_

- `snake_case` improves **readability** when dealing with **template-heavy, generic code**.
- Developers using **JH Toolkit alongside `std` will experience a uniform interface**, making it easier to:
    - **Mix and match `std` and `jh` components.**
    - **Reduce friction when integrating `jh-toolkit` into existing projects.**
    - **Lower the learning curve for new users already familiar with `std`.**

### **üìå 4. Future-Proofing for C++ Evolution**
> _"Following the direction of the standard makes long-term maintenance easier."_

- C++ is increasingly adopting **concept-based design** and modern **generic programming paradigms**.
- JH Toolkit **embraces these trends** by ensuring **consistent naming conventions** for **concepts, iterators, and utilities**.
- By aligning with `std`, JH Toolkit remains **future-proof** and **less likely to require adaptation** when integrating with **new standard features**.
